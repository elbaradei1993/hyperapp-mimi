fix: Correct mobile button text wrapping - remove truncation

- Remove white-space: nowrap and text-overflow: ellipsis that were causing text truncation
- Add white-space: normal to allow natural text wrapping on mobile
- Use min-width: min-content so buttons adapt to their content instead of fixed widths
- Set consistent 16px padding on mobile for better text spacing
- Improve line-height (1.2) for better readability of wrapped text
- Add specific handling for very small screens (360px and below) with smaller font size
- Fix quick action buttons with appropriate min-width and padding

Buttons now properly wrap text on mobile instead of truncating it, with adaptive sizing and consistent spacing.
