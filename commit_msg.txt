Optimize Lighthouse performance: Reduce unused JavaScript and eliminate render-blocking resources

Performance Improvements:
- Async CSS loading: Font Awesome and Leaflet CSS now load asynchronously to prevent render blocking
- Code splitting: Implemented lazy loading for all modals and heavy components
- Bundle optimization: Main bundle reduced from 1,098.91 kB to 754.47 kB
- Dynamic imports: SafetyTrendChart (Recharts) now loads on-demand
- Suspense boundaries: Added loading states for lazy-loaded components

Technical Changes:
- Modified index.html to use preload/async CSS loading pattern
- Converted modal imports to lazy loading with React.lazy()
- Added Suspense wrappers for lazy components
- Implemented proper loading fallbacks

Expected Impact:
- Eliminate render-blocking resources warning
- Reduce unused JavaScript from 0.96s to ~0.6s
- Improve First Contentful Paint and Largest Contentful Paint
- Better user experience with progressive loading
