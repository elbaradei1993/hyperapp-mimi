fix: Complete mobile button functionality with touch feedback and animations

- Remove CSS rule that disabled button:active transitions in index.css
- Add active: states to all button variants for proper touch feedback
- Enhance button-styles.css with comprehensive mobile touch optimizations
- Add touch-manipulation, prevent text selection, and improve focus states on mobile
- Ensure minimum touch targets (44px) and proper button spacing on mobile devices
- Fix button animations that were broken on touch devices

Buttons now provide proper visual feedback on mobile with scaling, shadow changes, and smooth transitions when tapped.
