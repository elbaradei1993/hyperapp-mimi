fix: Improve mobile button layout and prevent text cutoff

- Add responsive padding classes: buttons now have more horizontal padding on mobile (sm: breakpoint)
- Implement text overflow protection with ellipsis and word wrapping
- Allow text wrapping on very small screens (480px and below) for better readability
- Set minimum button widths (120px) to prevent cramped appearance
- Add forced padding overrides for better mobile proportions
- Update Tailwind safelist to include new responsive classes

Buttons now display properly on mobile with adequate padding, no text cutoff, and better visual proportions across all screen sizes.
