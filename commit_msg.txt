Fix mobile button sizing issues across the app

- Enhanced Button component with mobile-responsive sizing using Tailwind breakpoints
- Mobile (default): larger buttons (px-6 py-3 text-lg) for better touch targets
- Desktop (sm+): smaller buttons (px-4 py-2 text-base for md, px-3 py-1.5 text-sm for sm)
- Replaced inline styled buttons with responsive Button component in:
  - AuthModal (login/signup tabs and submit buttons)
  - VibeReportModal (cancel/submit buttons)
  - EmergencyReportModal (cancel/submit buttons)
  - ProfileView (edit profile button and modal actions)
- Preserved specialized components (TabNavigation, Header) with existing mobile optimizations
- Ensures minimum 44px touch targets and no text cutoff on mobile devices
